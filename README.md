# Neurona-rgbClassifier
A simple implementation of RGB color classifier model that can be deploy on Arduino AVR boards and other supported microcontroller. This repository uses the [Neurona](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/libraries/neurona/), an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) library for Arduino, it allows a [Multilayer perceptron](https://deepai.org/machine-learning-glossary-and-terms/multilayer-perceptron) (MLP) / feed-forward Neural Network, a Machinne Learning algorithm that can be run on Arduino boards. This library comes with the [MLP topology workbench](http://www.moretticb.com/MTW/) that trained the model, thenn deploy the model with Neurona library that port the model into a simple C++ code.
