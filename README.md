# Neurona-rgbClassifier
A simple RGB color classifier implementation for Arduino AVR boards and other compatible microcontrollers. This repository makes use of the [Neurona](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/libraries/neurona/) library for Arduino, which enables the use of a [Multilayer Perceptron](https://deepai.org/machine-learning-glossary-and-terms/multilayer-perceptron) (MLP) / Feed-forward Neural Network, a Machine Learning algorithm that can be run on Arduino boards. This library comes with the [MLP topology workbench](http://www.moretticb.com/MTW/), which is used to train the model, and the Neurona library, which is used to convert the model into simple C++ code. Thanks to [Caio Benatti Moretti's](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=0_3GTWkAAAAJ&hl=it) brilliant work.
